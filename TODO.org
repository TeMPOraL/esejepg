* TODO Make the pull-and-regenerate process triggerable from the web.
  Just so that I won't have to connect to the server every time I want to edit a translation.

  Just reminders about new essays.
* TODO OpenGraph descriptions
  - [X] Basic
  - [ ] Image

* TODO Ensure essays are readable on Instapaper, Pocket and whatever else people use.

  - progbot.html - Pocket seems to not like sidenotes - it either
    merges them into text, hides them, or kills a a whole paragraphw
    that contains them. TODO investigate.

  - progbot.html - MagicScroll removes all sidenotes, but leaves main
    text readable.

* DONE Smaller text font
* DONE Replace translator symbols with real names
  (probably need to build a translator database in a new lisp file)

* DONE Change location of .scss files to /src/
  (need to modify regeneration script)

* DONE Make essay descriptors be located in only one place
  (some lisp file loaded before generating templates)

* DONE Analytics

* DONE Meta keywords and description
  Keywords we don't need :).

* DONE humans.txt

* DONE Sitemap generation
  http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html
  The simplest way would be to list all HTML files and use them to output a basic sitemap :).

* DONE Comment regenerate.lisp well while you still remember what it does.

  W tym JS-powered paragraph links.
